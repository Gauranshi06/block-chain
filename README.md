## 1. Title  
**Cross Border Student Exchange with Blockchain Proof of Participation**

---

## 2. Description  
This project enables secure and transparent student exchange programs across international borders by leveraging blockchain technology. It ensures that each student's participation is recorded immutably on-chain as a proof of participation. The project will facilitate universities, students, and partner organizations to trust and verify exchange records without relying on third-party verification.

---

## 3. Vision of the Project  
Our vision is to create a global network of universities and institutions that recognize blockchain-based proofs of participation. This will enhance the credibility, trust, and interoperability of student exchange programs by:
- Removing the dependency on paper-based or centralized certificates.
- Making participation records universally verifiable.
- Empowering students with self-owned digital proof.

---

## 4. Future Scope  
- Integration with NFT-based participation certificates.
- On-chain verification system for companies and educational institutions.
- Cross-chain interoperability to make the system usable beyond the Aptos blockchain.
- Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for community governance of the project.
- Building a front-end DApp for students and institutions.
